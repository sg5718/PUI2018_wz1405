Haoming Yang, Jianwei Li, and I worked on this assignment together. 

Assignment 3 & 4:
I worked on these mainly but Junjie Cai offered me some help.



## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests as well as for the Readme.md

### GRADING: 

Your HW6\_\<netID\> README.md should show, in addition to the usual items (the scope of the homework, the group partecipants, your role in the group work) a two-row tables like the one above explaining the use of two tests in papers published in PLOS One.
