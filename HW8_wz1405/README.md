# Assignments
## Assignment 1

Create a plot, of whatever data (and models if you want) you choose from data of urban relevance (you can use any dataset we used in class, or something else, use your judgement here, but please no footbal statistics, or star flares. If you have doubt about whether your dataset is relevant for this homework please email me.) You can make the plot in any coding language you want (e.g. python, javascript, R...), as long as you upload the code that generates the plot onto this repo (which means no tableau, or any other non reproducible - carto is an exception, since you can see the processing tasks).

Create a directory HW8_<netID> in your PUI repo (with your netID). The plot neads to be uploaded onto the HW8 folder in your github PUI repo and be embedded in the README.md. That means: when I click on the HW8 link the plot must be rendered in the front page of the repo. Your readme must contain the plot, and a brief caption. If it is an interactive graphic, upload a static image of it in the README and provide a link to the interactive version.

Please make an effor to make it a good, compelling graphic. Put though into the esthetic of the plot, how clearly the content is communicated, avoid clutter, avoid misleading elements, mind your choice of colors accordingly to what was discussed in class.

Each of you needs to upload their own plot, no group submissions.

If your plot shows up as I described above in the repo and the code is also uploaded you will get 100% of the HW points. (Next week you will be tasked to review 3 plots of your classmates and you will be graded on the quality of the review.)

## Graph:

![](/HW8_wz1405/Figure1.png)

## Caption: 
This is a map of New York City with choropleth colored map with no significant border edges which divide the borders between vicinities. The areas on the map show the broadband internet access coverage. The lighter the color is, the percentage of Broadband Internet per 100 people is better and the darker the color is the Broadband Internet coverage percentage per 100 people is worse. The points on the map show the locations of linkNYC devices. The lighter the color is, the earlier the date it is set up; while the darker the color gets, the later the date the device is set up. We are able to see for most cases, the LinkNYC devices are in the area with less-accessible broadband internet connection to address the problem, such as the Flatbush Ave corridor in Brooklyn, the Queens Blvd corridor in Queens, and along the Second Avenue in the Upper East in Manhattan, etc. 


## Assignment 2

2. upload the notebook to github.
    - uploaded
3. Link the github notebook inside of Authorea article (Directions on how to do that are on the aithorea site)
    - link included in the article
4. Include a link to the authorea report in your readme in the homework repo.

*Grading*

You will be graded on the quality of the writing, as well as the correctness of the analysis. You will also be graded on whether you have discussed and considered the recommandations of your "referees", the classmates that reviewed your proposal.
